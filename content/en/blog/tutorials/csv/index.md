This tutorial describes setting up a study in a simple php server.
We will use the [simple-minno-server](https://github.com/minnojs/simple-minno-server) which is a rudimnetary and easy to install server for MinnoJS.
We will install it on a [AwardSpace](https://www.awardspace.com) 
which is one of many services offerering free php servers.

I recommend following allong this tutorial by performing each action as we go.
The practical experience gained this way is **a lot** more effective 
than the theoretical knowledge gained by just reading along.

Before beginining the installation, you should [set up an account](https://www.awardspace.com/free-web-hosting-registration/) on AwardSpace.
You should also download the files from the **simple-minno-server**, which can be found [here](https://github.com/minnojs/simple-minno-server/archive/master.zip).

### Setting up a subdomain
After setting up your account, you can start creating your study.
The first page that you see when you log into your account is the dashboard.
You can always get back here using the navigation bar at the top of the screen (Image 1 a).

In AwardSpace, you need to create a subdomain before you can start uploading your files, let’s do that first.
Go into the domain manager (image 1 b), and choose “Create a Free Subdomain” (image 2 a).
In the text input (image 2 b), choose a name for your server. 
We chose “minnojs-simple”, so that the URL for our study will be http://minnojs-simple.atwebpages.com/.
And finally click “Create” (image 2 c).

{{< image src="images/create.subdomain.png" title="Image 2: creating a subdomain" >}}
 
At the bottom of the page you can now see your subdomain. 
If you like, you can visit it already by clicking “Open Website” (Image 3 a), 
but your study has not been uploaded yet, so all you will see is a generic landing page.

### Uploading the system files

Now that we’ve created a subdomain for our study, we can start setting up the study.
Studies in the simple server are created simply by uploading files. 
We are aiming for a simple directory structure, 
with two files at the base directory (`index.html`, `csv.php`),
and the study files in a directory of their own (`study`).
The role of `index.html` is to activate the study, it is set up to activate the file `study/mgr.js`.
The role of `csv.php` is to record data sent from MinnoJS.
You shouldn't need to edit these files. Just upload and forget.

In order to upload the files, return to the dashboard (image 1 a), and go into the File Manager (image 1 c). 
You will now see a file explorer containing a single folder 
with the same name as the subdomain that you created (image 4).

{{< image src="images/files.root.png" title="Image 4: the file manager, in the root folder" >}}

Double click the folder name to navigate into it and then click “Upload” (image 5 a) 
in order to start uploading your files.
You can drag your files into the box in order to upload them (image 5 b).
We first upload [index.html](https://github.com/minnojs/simple-minno-server/blob/master/index.html), and [csv.php](https://github.com/minnojs/simple-minno-server/blob/master/csv.php). 
You can find these files in the root directory of [simple-minno-server](https://github.com/minnojs/simple-minno-server).

### Uploading the study files

Next, we create a folder to hold the files of our study.
Click “Create” (image 5 c) and create a directory named “study”. 
 
{{< image src="images/files.site.png" title="Image 5: the file manager, in the site folder" >}}

Finally, double click the “study” directory, click “Upload” again, and upload the study files 
found in the study directory in the [simple-minno-server](https://github.com/minnojs/simple-minno-server).
Later on, when you work on your own study, you can change these files into your own study files.

{{< image src="images/files.study.png" title="Image 6: the file manager, in the study folder" >}}

You can now see my study running at [minnojs-simple.atwebpages.com](http://minnojs-simple.atwebpages.com/).
In order to run your study, you can go back to the dashboard, choose Domain Manager and then click “Open website”.
Go ahead, run your study twice or thrice.

### Getting the results

You will see that a new folder has appeared in your site folder called “results” (near where you put `index.html` and `csv.php`).
This folder is created automatically if it does not exist whenever MinnoJS attempts to save data.
Double click this folder to see two types of files. 
There is an `.htaccess` file that has to do with server permissions.
You can safely ignore it - just leave it there. Each of the other files in this folder is a [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values
) file with the record for a single participant in you study.

This is basically all you need in order to deploy a study on AwardSpace.
The general idea should apply to any php server you deploy to, though the user interface is likely to be a bit different.
Experience shows that it is easiest to create new studies by transforming existing ones. 
You can use the study we created in the current tutorial, or you can use the more involved study in the [study.race](https://github.com/minnojs/simple-minno-server/tree/master/study.race) folder. 
Try copying its content into the “study” folder and see what happens.

### Editing you study

You can edit your files using the “edit” button in the “File Manager”,
or by editing it on you computer and re-uploading it.
But if you intend to do a lot of editing you might want to start using a program that allows easier
communication with the server (i.e. an FTP client. I highly recommend [FileZilla]( https://filezilla-project.org/
)).

That's it really.
Go ahead, try it out.
It's easier than it looks.
