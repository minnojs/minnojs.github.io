This page contains the minimum requirements to install the Minnosuite Dashboard.

### Common Requirements

Make sure to install the software on a computer that has **at least 2 GB** free disc space. We recommend more space (e.g., 10 Gb), to make sure you have enough for many participants and many studies.  

Although you can restrict the platform to local usage (i.e., participants will complete the experiments on the same computer that runs this software), the platform was developed to enable running studies over the Internet. For that, make sure you are able to **listen to port 80** on the computer, which may require administrator access, and have **port 80 open to the world and not blocked by your firewall**. We strongly recommend **opening port 443** as well (listen and allow access), to allow secure (SSL) connection over the Internet. Additionally, the machine should have a **static IP address**.

You will probably also want to have a domain for your server.  We have a guide for setting up a domain for free with Freenom [here](../domain).  However, you do not need to do that if you already have a domain for your machine, or if your IT department can set up a domain for you.
